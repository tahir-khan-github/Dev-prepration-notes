1)what is node js red
    It is visual programming tool for nodejs that is used to wire hardware devices & online services as part of IOT application

2)diff bw operational error and programming error
    Operational errors are errors that occur due to external factors (network error, database connection failure, file not found)
    Programming errors, occur due to mistakes  in the code written by developers(synatx or logical error)

3)what is blocking code
    it refers to operations that halt the execution of a program until a particular task is completed.

4)what is setTimeOut()
    it is a built-in function in JavaScript that allows you to schedule a function to be executed after a specified period of time.

5)what is callback
    a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed

6)What is callback hell
     situation where multiple nested callbacks make code difficult to read and maintain. 
     This typically occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations in JavaScrip

7)diff b/w async & await
    The async keyword is used to mkae a function as asynchronous, which function returns a promise 
    and it doesn't block the execution of other code outside the function.
    -----
    The await keyword can only be used inside async functions. It pauses the execution of the function until the promise is completed

8)javascript vs nodejs
    JavaScript is a scripting language used to create dynamic and interactive content on websites, primarily executed in web browsers.
    Node js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be used for server-side development

9)what is singlethreaded programming
    it executes tasks one at a time in a sequential manner, using one call stack and one memory heap

9.1)if node js single threaded then how nodejs handles multiple task at once
    it takes all the request in the event queue and an event loop is watching over it, the event loop takes out request in FIFO and checks
    whether request is blocking or nob-blocking , if its non-blocking it executes it , and if its blocking it sends it to thread pool
    thread pool assigns a thread to request which is responsible for completing the request
    threads are limited , by default it uses 4 threads and once thread is free only then new request will be assigned 

9.2)runtime environment vs framework
    A runtime environment provides the infrastructure and services required to execute code written in a particular programming language
    A framework is a pre-built set of tools, libraries designed for the development of specific types of applications

9.3)node vs express
    Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
    Express is a  framework for Node.js that provides a set of features to develop  applications.

9.4)advantages and disadvantages of nodejs
    advantages: 
    Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows it to handle multiple requests concurrently 
    JavaScript can be used both at FE & BE 
    ITs cross-platform support works on windows,mac
    Large ecosystem becoz of npm
    
    disadvantages: 
    Lack of Built-in Support for Multi-threading,
    Callback Hell:Asynchronous programming in Node.js often leads to deeply nested callbacks, 

9.6)synchronus vs asynchronous
    Synchronous operations are those that are executed sequentially.
    Asynchronous operations allow tasks to be executed without blocking the execution of other tasks

9.7)what is event loop?
    whenever code executes it goes to event queue and event loop watching over it pull out the request and checks wether its a synchronus or asynchronous
    if synchronus its executes it right away.
    if asynchronous then it send the request to thread pool where a thread is assigned to it for execution of request.

9.8)microtask queue vs macrotask queue?
    event loop will send promises to microtask queue which has higher priority to be executed after synchronus completed from callstack
    event loop will send fs module code and setTimeOut code will go to macrotask queue , again setTimeOut will get executed first

9.9)how nodejs handles asynchronous task?
    it handles it using
    1)callbacks
    2)promises with then and catch
    3)async await better than promises

10)what is npm and node_modules, package json
    npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager containing libraries which we use in our nodejs code
    a directory that stores all the installed packages and their dependencies for a project

11)what are modules in nodejs and types of module  and ways of importing and exporting it
    modules are individual pieces of code that can be reused across different parts of an application.
    types:
    1)core module: os, fs
    2)local module: which we develop
    3)third party module: installed from npm (express, loadash)
    ----
    CommonJS: Uses module.exports and require()
    ES6 Modules: Uses export and import

11.1)how to import single or multiple modules in nodejs
    module.exports = {
        add,
        subtract,
        multiply
    };

    const math = require('./math');
    math.add()
    ----------------
    export { add, subtract, multiply };
    export default pi;

    import pi, { add, subtract, multiply } from './math.mjs';
    we can rename default export while importing

11.2)diifference between require and import
    require - its used in commonJs modules (with module.exports), Synchronous execution.
    import - its used on ES modules (with export) , synchronus and asynchronous execution.

12)what is fs module and where does it run
    fs.readFile(file, format, (err, data) => {})
    const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
    fs.writeFile(file, content, (err) => {})
    fs.writeFileSync(file, content)
    fs.appendFile(file, content, (err) => {})
    fs.unlink('example.txt', (err) => {})

    async functions runs on thread pool and synchronus works on main thread

12.1)what is path module
    path.basename(filePath); //last portion of a path (the file name).
    path.dirname(filePath); //directory name of a path '/users/admin/documents'
    path.extname(filePath); // gives file extenstion
    path.join('/users', 'admin', 'documents', 'file.txt');
    path.resolve('users', 'admin', 'documents', 'file.txt');// absolute path from root '/' is given it will start from here

12.2)what is os module
        os.platform()   //gives Operating system
        os.arch() //gives cpu architectur

12.3)what is http module
        http module allows you to create an HTTP server that can listen for and respond to HTTP requests.
        ---createServer--------
        const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
            res.statusCode = 200;
            res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
            res.end('Hello, World!\n');
        });
        const PORT = 3000;
        server.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}/`);
        });
    ----------CRUD--------------------
    const server = http.createServer((req,res)=>{
        res.setHeaders('Content-type','Application/Json');

        if(req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/items'){
            res.end(JSON.stringyfy(items));
        }else if(req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/items'){
            let body = '';
            req.on("data", (chunk) => body += chunk);
            req.on("end", ()=>{
                const item = {id: 1, name: "abcd"};
                items.push(item);
                res.end(JSON.stringfy(item))
            })
        }else if(req.method === 'PUT'  && req.url.startsWith(/items/)){
            const id = req.url.split("/")[2]
            let body = '';
            = chunk);
            req.on("end", ()=>{
               const index = items.filter((i) => i.id === id);
               if(index != -1){
                items[index] = {id, ...JSON.parse(body)};
               }
                res.end(JSON.stringfy(items[index] || {error: "Not found"}))
            })

        }else if(req.method === 'DELETE' && req.url.startsWith(/items/)){
             const id = req.url.split("/")[2];
             const items = items.filter((e) => e.id != id);
             res.end(JSON.stringfy( {message: "Item deleted successfully!"}))
        }else{
             res.end(JSON.stringfy( {error: "Invalid route"}))
        }
    })

    server.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server on http://localhost:3000"));

15)what is ip adress and how to obtain ip adress of user in nodejs
    An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network
     const ipAddress = req.headers['x-forwarded-for'] || req.connection.remoteAddress;

16)What are the advantages of using promises instead of callbacks?
    The main advantage of using promise is you get an object to decide the action that needs to be taken after the async task completes. 
    This gives more manageable code and avoids callback hell

17)Difference b/w setTimeOut() and setImmediate() and process.nextTick()?
    all of them are asynchronous functions that register callbacks into queues to run later
    event loop will check and execute it using thread pool, but setTimeOut callback has higher priority so it will execute first
    and process.nextTick() callback will start before every event loop starts

    setImmediate() // check queue
    setTimeOut() //timer queue
    
18)What are streams in Node.js?
    Streams in Node.js are objects that allow you to read or write data continuously It handles large amount of data without loading all into memory
    const readStream = fs.createReadStream('filename', format);
    readStream.on('data', (chunk)=>{
        console.log(chunk)
    })

19)Explain how clustering works in Node.js and when should be it used?
    Clustering in Node.js refers to the process of creating multiple instances of the Node.js process, known as worker processes that shares the same server port, 
     to take advantage of multi-core systems and distribute the workload across multiple CPU cores. 

20)how to secure nodejs application?
    1)Use https
    2)Valdiate input
    3)implement security headers
    4)sanatize user input

21)how do you manage environment variables in nodejs
    require(dotenv).config();
    console.log(process.env.variable_name)
    it loads env variables from .env file into process.env , preventing hardcoded credentials

22)what are worker threads in nodejs and how they improve performance?
    worker threads allow nodejs to execute cpu intensive tasks in seprate threads, preventing event loop from blocking

23)If Node.js is single threaded then how does it handle concurrency?
    Due to many reason:
    > Event loop
    > Asynchronous Operations
    > Libuv and the Thread Pool for blocking operations (libuv sends these tasks to a thread pool (default size = 4 threads)
    > Worker Threads (runs code on sepreate thread)

24) child process and its functions?
    Nodejs provides child process module to run scripts outside the main event loop, in a separate system process.
    spawn() is Use when you want to run a command continuously and stream data.
    fork() is Specifically used to create a new Node.js process.
    exec() Runs a command and buffers the entire output in memory 

---------------------Rest Api------------------
1)what is an api?
   api is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other

2)what is Rest and rest api?
    REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. 
        Stateless Communication: The server does not keep track of client state between requests, Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request
        Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities, allowing them to evolve independently.
        Standard HTTP Methods:
        GET: Retrieve a resource.
        POST: Create a new resource.
        PUT: Update an existing resource.
        DELETE: Remove a resource.
        PATCH: Partially update a resource.
    api that are developed on REST principals are rest api

3)what is URI?
    A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a resource on the internet
        it contains scheme(https), domain name, path, query, 

4)what are idempotent methods?
    An idempotent method is one that, no matter how many times you call it with the same input, the result is the same.
    like get, put, delete they will show have no effect after first application
    but POST is non-idempotent as every time it will change the state

5)what is SOAP ?
    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) one of a Protocol like REST,but  its much stricter than REST and It's  based on XML.

-------------------Express-------------------
1)what is middleware?
    Middleware is a function that sits in the middle of the request-response cycle.
    example - authentication middleware, which check for the request before it reaches to route handler 

    app.use(express.json()); //to access  json data in request
    app.use(express.urlencoded()); // to access  formdata data in request
    app.use(cookieParser()); // to access cookie


2)how error handling is done?
  using try catch or next() in express


3)how authentication is done?
    HLD

4)role of next() in express
    next() will move the working to flow to the next handler
    if some argument is passed then flow moves to matching handler
    inorder to handle error we return next() with error class

5)microservice Architecture?
    HLD

6)How to scale app for more user?
    HLD

7)How nodejs load using requrie and import?
When you call require() in Node.js, it first resolves the file path ,
then loads and wraps the module code inside a function for scoping. The module is executed once,
its exports are returned,
and it’s cached in require.cache for future calls.
This mechanism is part of Node’s CommonJS module system.


8)typescript with design principle and oops
    LLD


9)error handling in nodejs

app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Some async code
    const data = await fetchData();
    res.send(data);
  } catch (err) {
    next(err); // Pass to error middleware
  }
});

// Centralized error handler
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ message: 'Something went wrong!' });
});

10)What are “uncaught exceptions” and “unhandled promise rejections”?
    Uncaught Exception: Synchronous error not caught anywhere
    Unhandled Rejection: A rejected promise without .catch()
