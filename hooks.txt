Hooks:-

1)useState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. 
It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it. 
The Hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an updated state value whenever the setter function is called.
React will rerender its component on changing the useStateValue, 

2)seEffect hook in React is used to handle the side effects in React such as fetching data, and updating DOM
The useEffect Hook is like a function takes two arguments: a callback function and an optional dependency array. 
The callback function will be executed after rendering,
and the dependency array will determine when the effect should be re-run.
* return ()=>{} inside useEffect will run when component gets unmount

3)useContext Hook allows us to consume values from a React "Context". 
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down at every level.


 4)useRef is a hook that allows you to create a mutable reference to an element or a value
 or to create reference of an element
 const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const focusInput = () => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
    </div>
    )

5)useMemo
useMemo is a React Hook that lets you memoize/cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.
useMemo(()=>{},[])
useMemo(generateId,[]) -> means it will generateId only when component gets loaded for the first time
useMemo(generateId,[value]) -> means it will generateId only when value state gets changes

6)useCallBack
useCallBack is a React Hook that lets us cache a function defination between re-renders. which will avoid recreating of it on each rendering
const fun = useCallBack(()=>,[]);
fun();
Also we can prevent rerenderig of child component on parent component rendering
export default memo(child component name)

7) useParams Hook helps to access the parameters of the current route 

8)useNavigate hook is used ti navigate between pages
